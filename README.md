## About 
Having just finished my C++ Bank System project, I wanted to continue programming to keep myself entertained. I decided to make a grade calculator as that was something that could be of use for me to calculate my grades ahead of them being released for our results day. Aside from that, this also served as a good project to experiment more with Python as it's a language I had less experience with at the time.

## Features
- Ability to add a module
- Add multiple grades (up to a total of 100%)
- Input percentages to avoid having to worry about searching for marks
- Prints out total percentage

## Things I've learnt
- Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Making the script suited for multiple operating systems
- Creating tools in Python
- Validating user input

## Usage
```
- Run the grade_calculator.py script with Python:
  python grade_calculator.py
```

## Enter Module Name
