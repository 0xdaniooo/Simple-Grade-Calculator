# Simple-Grade-Calculator
A simple command line tool written in Python to make calculating your grades easier (based on percentages)

## About 
After finishing my first year of University, I wanted to get back into coding. Making a grade calculator was thus fitting for the occassion as it was a tool I could use for my own purposes and something which would allow me to return to the realm of programming.

## Features
- Ability to add a module
- Add multiple grades (up to a total of 100%)
- Input percentages to avoid having to worry about searching for marks
- Prints out total percentage

## Things I've learnt
- Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Making the script suited for multiple operating systems
- Creating tools in Python
- Validating user input

## Usage
```
- Run the grade_calculator.py script with Python:
  python grade_calculator.py
```
